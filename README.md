## OpenTNSim-Energy
### Advancing decarbonization in waterborne supply chains worldwide


OpenTNSim-Energy is a validated open-source software, which quantitatively simulates the energy consumption, fuel use (for both diesel and renewable energy sources) and emissions (CO2, PM10, NOx) of vessels sailing over waters. 

Besides the inland freight shipping application showing by the schematic diagram below, OpenTNSim-Energy is enriching itself by adding multiple features for both inland and ocean freight shipping, include

- optimal sailing, loading and energy saving strategies for individual vessels,  
- cargo-fuel (renewables) trade-offs on board,  
- cost and benefit scenarios for ship retrofit choices,  
- bunkering infrastructure planning for renewables for ports and inland corridors,
- emission reduction policy making supporting,
- ...

OpenTNSim-Energy is built upon **Open** source **T**ransport **N**etwork **Sim**ulation (OpenTNSim) (Van Koningsveld & Den Uijl, 2020, URL: https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenTNSim/, doi:10.5281/zenodo.3813871) 

OpenTNSim-Energy benefits all the related stakeholders (shipping companies, ship builders, marine engine manufacturers, energy suppliers, policy makers, authorities, etc.) in short and long terms during waterborne energy transition.


## Installation

To install OpenTNSim-Energy, run this command in your terminal:
